# IPL Dataset Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the IPL dataset consisting of matches and ball-by-ball deliveries.  
The goal is to uncover patterns in match results, player performances, team strategies, and other key aspects of the game through exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Datasets Description
- **Matches Table** – Contains information about each IPL match (season, teams, toss decision, result, venue, etc.).  
- **Deliveries Table** – Contains ball-by-ball details of every match (batter, bowler, runs, extras, dismissal details, etc.).

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Toss Decisions and Winning Trends
- Teams that win the toss and choose to field first have a higher probability of winning.  
- Toss decision plays a significant role in match outcomes.

### Match Results Analysis
- The majority of matches are won by chasing teams.  
- Very few matches end in ties or no results.

### Team Performance Over Seasons
- Mumbai Indians (MI) and Chennai Super Kings (CSK) consistently dominate across seasons.  
- Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) and Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) show intermittent strong performances.  

### Venue-Wise Matches & Wins
- Eden Gardens, Wankhede, and M. Chinnaswamy Stadium host the most matches.  
- Certain teams have clear home-ground advantages (e.g., CSK at Chepauk).  

### Player Performance Highlights
- Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers form one of the strongest batting pairs in IPL history.  
- Chris Gayle leads in big-hitting and sixes.  
- Lasith Malinga remains one of the most successful wicket-takers.  

### Partnerships
- Kohli–AB de Villiers partnerships consistently yield high runs.  
- Top batting pairs contribute significantly to team totals in multiple matches.  

### Dismissal Patterns
- **Caught** is the most common form of dismissal.  
- Bowled and LBW occur far less frequently.  

### Over-Wise Scoring Trends
- Overs **14–16** typically produce the highest runs (power-hitting phase).  
- Death overs (17–20) show aggressive scoring but also higher dismissals.  

### Extras Contribution
- Distribution of extras:  
  - **Wide balls** contribute the most.  
  - Followed by **leg byes**.  
  - **No-balls** contribute the least.  

### Dot Ball Kings
- Bowlers who deliver the most dot balls:  
  - Bhuvneshwar Kumar  
  - Sunil Narine  
  - Ravichandran Ashwin  
  - Jasprit Bumrah  
  - Piyush Chawla
